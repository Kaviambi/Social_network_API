# NoSQL: Social Network API

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

We will be using `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, and the `Mongoose` ODM and `moment` to show timestamps. The data seeding is created using Insomnia.

## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
